Exercise 14 – Functions Objective

• To practise creating functions
• To revisit conditional structures
• To use built-in functions

Task A: Create a Game: Rock, Paper, Scissors!

You are going to create a command line version of the game: Rock...Paper...Scissors!

The user will play against the computer at this game. You should design a program that does the following:

• Prompts the user to enter a value: R, P or S
• The program should convert this value into Rock, Paper, or Scissors respectively
• Asks the computer to generate a random value between 0 and 2
• Convert the computer’s choice. 0 becomes Rock; 1 becomes Paper; 2 becomes Scissors
• Compare the user’s choice with the computer’s choice to display a message indicating whether
the user won, lost or drew against the computer
• Showcase what you have learned about conditional statements and create your own functions

Note:
Rock smashes Scissors, Paper wraps Rock, Scissors cut Paper!

Task B: Compare programs

Compare your solution to other class members’.

• Have you achieved this differently?
• Does anyone’s solution stand out?
• How would you structure your code differently?
• Would you consider changing the names of your variables or functions?
